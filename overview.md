# CSV to JSON Converter

A Visual Studio Code extension that converts documents between CSV and JSON formats. Converting documents between the two formats is now as easy as it sounds, plus you get the converted document in a well-structured format.

## Features

* Swift conversion.
* Saves converted document to a new file with the same name and folder as those of the old file, and it prompts you to open the new file after conversion.
* Converts documents with readable and well-structured formatting.
* Dedicated keyboard shortcuts for quick and easy conversion.

## Usage

* Focus the cursor on the text editor containing the document to be converted

* Bring up the command palette using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Shift+P or F1 on macOS

* Search for "Convert CSV to JSON" or "Convert JSON to CSV" on the dialog box that comes up, as the case may be, then press Enter.

* This extension comes with a dedicated keyboard shortcut. Thus, alternatively, when the text editor is on focus, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+J on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Option+J on macOS to convert a CSV document to JSON, and Ctrl+Alt+C on Windows/Linux or Cmd+Option+C on macOS to convert a JSON document to CSV.
